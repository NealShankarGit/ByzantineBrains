# The Byzantine Brains: Fault-Tolerant Consensus with LLMs

## Project Overview
The Byzantine Brains project explores fault-tolerant consensus-building in distributed AI systems using large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the Byzantine Generals Problem, the project aims to develop a scalable, reliable system for robust decision-making in uncertain environments.

## Objectives
- Develop a distributed AI system leveraging LLMs for dynamic negotiation and conflict resolution.
- Analyze and address the Byzantine Generals Problem in real-time AI interactions.
- Explore novel applications of consensus algorithms in multi-agent frameworks.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Python (or TBD)  
- **Frameworks**: Multi-agent frameworks (TBD)

## Project Structure
TBD
